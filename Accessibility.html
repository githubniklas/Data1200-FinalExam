  <div class="accessibility-info1">
<p class="accessibility-paragraph">Accessibility is a very important concept to consider when coding. Digital applications can be used by everyone if they are made for it.
  And if we can help everyone have access to something we should do it, especially if the application is something important like a government website. 
  Most website should be made considering accessibility issues so that everyone can make use of the internet.</p>

<h3 class="accessibility-subheader">What Is Accessibility</h3>
<p class="accessibility-paragraph">Accessibility is the concept of making something that is usable by people with disabilities that would otherwise stop them from using it if they were not considered when making it.
 For example, making a staircase. If you just make the staircase, it would be difficult for people that are in a wheelchair to make it to the second floor. 
  Too follow the principles of accessibility you have too also make an elevator or a ramp. When it comes to accessibility in web design the most affected disabilities
  are visual ones, like poor eyesight or color blindness. There are two core concepts that is key when it comes to accessibility universal design and inclusive design.
 Universal design is about making something usable by the most amount of people without specialized design. Inclusive design is about making the product available to
  as many users as possible.</p>

    <div class="accessibility-text">
    <h3 class="accessibility-subheader">Our experience</h3>
    <p class="accessibility-paragraph3">For the accessibility for our website, we decide to make a website based on universal design and not include any inclusive design. 
      Since our website is not something important that everyone needs to access, it is easier to make it based on a universal design. 
      We decided to make a website that is compliant with AA level according too WCAG 2.1. We saw this as a level we could obtain relatively easily since the website
      doesn’t include videos, sound, moving objects or flashing colors. Too check how accessible our pages where we used a chrome extension called “wave”.
      With this we found that we hadn’t considered the contrast of the text and the background color. Other accessibility solutions like alternative text for images or,
      having the website work with keyboard navigations We originally had a light color as the background for the white text which did not have a high enough contrast
      with the background, so we changed the text from white to black. There are a lot of accessibility problems that seem small and insignificant to those
      that do not have the disability those problems are caused by. This makes them difficult to identify but, just because it is difficult doesn’t mean we shouldn’t do it.</p>
